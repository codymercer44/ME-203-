# Homework 1

Problem 1. A projectile is launched at an angle of 55 degrees from the horizontal with a velocity
of 30m/s. Neglecting air resistance and assuming a horizontal surface, determine the following:
a. How far away from the launch site the projectile will land.
b. The maximum height the projectile will reach. (Hint: Max height is reached at half the time
of flight)


Problem 2. Create a table that shows the conversion of degrees to radians for 0-360 degrees
counting by 10 degrees. Show a table and XY scatter plot with a trend line and equations, axis
labels and a title.

Problem 3. You are buying a car that costs $15,000. The bank secured a loan at 6% interest,
which you have to pay off in 60 months.
a. Calculate the monthly payment using the built in PMT function.
b. You find the payment in part (a) to be too high. You can afford only a monthly payment of
$225. How many monthly payments of $225 will you need to make until the loan is paid off?
(Use Goal Seek).

Problem 4. A “stiff” spring is one that gets stronger the more it is compressed, unlike a linear
spring for which the spring constant is constant. Suppose the force in a stiff spring is defined by
the function F(x) = kx+mx3, where x is the amount of compression, k= 500 N/m and m=10,000
N/m3. Using the Solver function, find the compression x (meters) of the spring if a force of 250
N is applied.

Problem 5. Use Excel Solver function to find a local maximum of the following function:
x4-x3-7x2+x+6. Show your work before and after.


Problem 6. Your boss at NASA has asked you to design a cylindrical tank for storing cryogenic
propellant. The tank should be able to hold 2000 liters of the propellant. The tank should have
minimum possible surface area to minimize heat transfer with the surroundings. Use Solver
function to determine the radius (r) and height (h) of the tank.


Problem 7. Use the following information and Goal Seek to find what value of d gives a
deflection of 1mm. Your results should look like the sample below the problem description. Use
the convert function for ALL unit conversions.

Problem 8:
The equivalent letter grades for numerical values of points is given in the table below.

89-80 B
79-70 C
69-60 D
